    # if False, data are published with sensor data QoS. This is preferrable

    # Set the method used to timestamp measurements.
    # Valid modes are:
    #
    #   TIME_FROM_INTERNAL_OSC
    #   TIME_FROM_SYNC_PULSE_IN
    #   TIME_FROM_PTP_1588
    #   TIME_FROM_ROS_RECEPTION

    # information).

    timestamp_mode: TIME_FROM_INTERNAL_OSC

    # Mask-like-string used to define the data processors that should be
    # activated upon startup of the driver. This will determine the topics
    # that are available for client applications to consume. The defacto
    # reference for these values are defined in:
    # `include/ros2_lidar/OS1/processor_factories.hpp`
    #
    # For convenience, the available data processors are:
    #
    # IMG   - Provides 8-bit image topics suitable for ML applications encoding
    #         the noise, range, intensity, and reflectivity data from a scan
    # PCL   - Provides a point cloud encoding of a LiDAR scan
    # SCAN  - Provides a synthesized 2D LaserScan from the 3D LiDAR data
    #
    # To construct a valid string for this parameter join the tokens from above
    # (in any combination) with the pipe character. For example, valid strings
    # include (but are not limited to):
    #

    # PCL
    #
    
    # os1_proc_mask: IMG|PCL|SCAN
